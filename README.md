# VINA - Movie Matcher Project 2
####What Does It Do?
The Movie Matcher app is a great way to get upcoming, up to date movie selections for the user to go see based on personality traits. No more accidentally going to see a movie that you might not like because it doesn't really fit your personality.

####How Does It Work?
When the user arrives at the Movie Matcher app for the first time they are going to create a new account by clicking the "Join Me" link.  The user will enter an email and password they would like to use for re-accessing the app later. Once confirmed that the users new login and password are valid the user is taken to movie personality survey to gauge what type of movies would be best be fit for their personality. The user is then able to sign out and return at any time sign in with their login again and see an updated movie list with new upcoming movies based on the original personality survey.
